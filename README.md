## mcpe-docs
Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Documentation (for developers).

This repo actually holds the files to a website. If you view the files on Github, links may not work, and file formatting could possibly be messed up. Either visit the website or run it locally.

### Running locally
This site uses Jekyll, so google how to install that.

After installing, clone the repo and run:
```
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll serve
```
